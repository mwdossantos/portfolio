Thank you for taking the time to read this week's update. As you can see in the following table, I have a couple of activities planned that I will do in order to get my desired result: Planning.

| Activities                      | Finalized |
| :------------------------------ | :-------: |
| Individual lo-fi & hi-fi design |    ✅     |
| Frontend pages                  |    ✅     |
| Custom CSS per member           |    ✅     |

But first, let's look what the team has been up to this week.

# Teamwork

This was the first week where I noticed a decline in communication from Bo. There was no response for a couple of days, and she was not attending class. This was worrying me as she was responsible for the hi-fi design of the home page for the website, which I was going to build this week.

During one of the classes of this week I had a call with Paul, and discussed the matter with him. I was really struggling with the fact that the longer I would wait the less time I would have for programming the website, and the lower the chance would be to successfully finish this minor.

That's why Paul helped me come up with a solution. I sent the team a message that I am too happy with the fact that communication is being let down, and that we will need to have the hi-fi design finalized by the end of this week. If that wasn't the case, then I would continue without Bo and make sure we get the minor finished.

Luckily, after that message, we got a response. I won't go into personal details but this step of communication towards Bo helped her open up about what's not going well. Eventually though, she really pulled through and managed to finish the hi-fi design for the home page today (friday!).

The team was very proud. Here's the tasks we did this week:

## Planning

As I explained in the previous section, there was a slight hiccup in progression earlier in the week, but Bo stepped up and finalized the hi-fi design wich puts us right back on track.

I also had a call with the team about how they experience the planning and team management. They said that the Trello helps a lot but that they also would like to have more weekly calls. Sadly, due to the busy schedules of everybody it's hard to plan calls outside of the school days themselves.

To solve this, we plan to have a call after every class and discuss the progression of that week.

# My activities

Time for my individual activities I did this week to finalize this week's work.

## Individual lo-fi & hi-fi design

Earlier in my documentation I have mentioned that we will add a personal touch to the portfolio website. The reasoning behind this goes as follows: we had three individual blocks and I want to highlight the individuality of this minor in a single website.

That's why we decided to go crazy, and create our own page designs per person. In the process, I have created a simple lo-fi and hi-fi mockup of my page design and style to illustrate my own personal style.

I went with a sleek and dark tone, with a black background. This way I was sure it was going to stand out from the rest of the portfolios and my imagery would get the best chance to shine.

For the lo-fi and hi-fi designs I suggest taking a look at our team's [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HIra3IzK8GgAsaU7MI9ZL7/Minor-4-Portfolio?node-id=79%3A2) file so that you can click through their pages.
