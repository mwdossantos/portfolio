# Portfolio

Welcome good sir!

You are in the repository for the group portfolio of block 4, part of the minor KB-86. See the "Planning" underneath to navigate to each week's documentation.

You can view the portfolio [here](https://wowportfolios.nl) or alternatively keep reading to run the project yourself.

## Running this project

If you have the desire to run the project locally and check out all of the source code in your favorite editor, please do so. You can clone this repository through GitHub.

> Be sure to have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Front end

Once cloned, be sure to run `npm install` in the root of the repository. Once all `node_modules` are installed you can run the front end by using the command `npm run dev`. A localhost port will open and you can click away!

### Back end

If you want to see the back end you can do so by first running `npm install` in the `sanity` folder. `cd` into it and run the command. Once finished, be sure to run `sanity install` and then `sanity start`. A localhost port will open and the studio will be up and running.

You will need an account to access it, so send me an [email](mailto:tengoldblums@icloud.com) so that I can create an account for you!

That's all for now, have a good day.

Best regards,
Matthew Wilson
