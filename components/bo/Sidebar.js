            <p>
                Welcome to my journey. My creative journey, so to say. The past 20 weeks have really
                been a creative journey to me. I started out with asking myself “Bo, what do you
                want to do, learn, achieve?” Now that I had time to work freely on personal
                development thru school, I couldn't hasitate for one second: I wanted to illustrate
                and do something of value with the illustrations which I'll create. Then, I knew it.
                I was going to learn how to illustrate women’s faces, in order to use these
                illustrations to create digital ones. These - digital - illustrations I wish to use
                someday for the branding of my own research company, in order to combine UX-
                research with women empowerment within IT. I want these women centered illustrations
                to be the centre of branding. With this I mean for the faces to be on the logo,
                story boards, cards, web pages etc. That's my dream. So, alright, I had found my
                ambition. First I studied (digital) illustrators and their work. I wondered if they
                could always illustrate like this; the old nature nurture affair. I decided that it
                was time for some research. I contacted as many illustrators that inspired me as
                possible. I asked them about their way to their illustrating style. How did it
                become their personal style? Is there even such a thing as personal style? Well, I
                had a lot of questions. As it turns out, every illustrator that contacted me kind of
                had their own vision on style, but the final conclusion was that style is both
                nature and nurture and that it grows on your, it evolves with you through time. The
                celebration of diversity and - my all time life motto - ‘imperfection is perfection’
                are the core of my illustrations. Diversity is a hot topic at the moment when you
                look at the fashion industry for example. In my opinion, it must be celebrated.
                Imperfection is perfection. Simply the truth; we're people. Perfection is an
                opinion. Not a term. In my illustrations I tried to accentuate these common face's
                ‘imperfections’. They make the face. So, now that you kinda know the story about my
                illustrations, I hope you enjoy looking at them. Or create your own view on them. Or
                if you're reading this after you've seen them... now you know. I'd love to hear from
                you, no matter the cause. Everything and everyone is welcome. Thank you. Bo. (;
